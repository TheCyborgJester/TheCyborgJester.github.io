# Project 1

## Microsoft Azure SIEM

In my time working for a vendor for Microsoft. It has given me different opportunities to learn all about Microsoft Azure. From the on-premise part of the Sync Engine to everything Device related, how to join to Azure, How to set up Windows Hello for Business (WHFB) etc. I took advantage of the test environment given to me by Microsoft and set up my own Personal SIEM within Azure.
